# Computer Science Course Slides
These are the slides that I use in all of my computer science classes. All slides are available from my school website here: [https://www.whscs.net/courses/](https://www.whscs.net/courses/)

The slides are generated using these tools:
* [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) - HTML Presentations
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) - Allows me to write my content in Markdown and convert to reveal.js
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) - Templating engine that makes sure all my presentations look similar, and makes it easy to reuse content
