# Warmup

## Warmup
- I graded your Pokemon Projects - sorry for the delay!
- Most got great grades. Some are missing small requirements. 
- Take a look and feel free to resubmit by Dec 15.






# Let's talk about AI


## AI - Rule in my class
- I think it's a great thing, and an important skill for you to learn
- We'll have a lot of fun with AI this year
- Unless I say so, do not use it on any assignments
- If you claim AI-generated work as your own, I will catch it and I will write a referral
    - Same rule for youtube videos, quillbot, course hero, chegg, etc.


## Here's some food for thought

## About the Pokemon Project
- Lots of people wrote their code in about one minute
- Lots of people submitted code that was exactly the same as other students' code
- Lots of people submitted very advanced code
    - many of those same people failed the test on the same subject


## My Response
- For now, nothing
- Copy/paste is blocked going forward
- For all future projects, I'll assume that you aren't working alone
    - Working together, AI, etc are all okay. But you MUST give credit to your sources and explain how much of the work is yours
    - Sample acceptable comment: "I copy/pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and entirely kept the code it generated"
- You must completely understand the code you submit
- Each assignment will have an in-class component
