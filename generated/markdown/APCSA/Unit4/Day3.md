# Warmup

## Warmup

# Let's talk about AI


## AI - Rule in my class
- I think it's a great thing, and an important skill for you to learn
- We'll have a lot of fun with AI this year
- Unless I say so, do not use it on any assignments
- If you claim AI-generated work as your own, I will catch it and I will write a referral
    - Same rule for youtube videos, quillbot, course hero, chegg, etc.


## Here's some food for thought
