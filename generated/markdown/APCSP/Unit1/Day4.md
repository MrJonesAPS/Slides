% APCSP: More Binary
% Unit 1, Day 4
% Mr. Jones | AP Computer Science Principles


# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like

- Find your nametag and stand it up on your desk
- Take a look at your grade in studentvue
- Discuss this question with your neighbors:
When we convert text to binary - did we lose anything in the process?


# Recap Unit 1, Day 4

## Last time we...
- Looked at parts of a computer
- Invented counting systems with everyday objects

# Today: Representing more complex data

## Before we start, some vocab:
- Analog
- Digital
- Abstraction
- Sampling
- Loss

## Before we start, some vocab:
- Analog: Information in the real world
- Digital: Information converted for storage on a computer
- Abstraction: Taking something complex and making a simpler version
- Sampling: Collecting little pieces of information
- Loss: Information that you lose from sampling

## Images: Levels of abstraction
1. Divide an image into pixels
2. Convert each pixel into a single color
3. Map each color to the closest available color
4. Convert the color to binary

## Practice - with black and white
- See "Black and White Images Activity" on Canvas

## Practice - with colors
- Your assignment: Create art with post-it notes
