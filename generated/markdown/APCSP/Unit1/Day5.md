% APCSP: More Binary
% Unit 1, Day 5
% Mr. Jones | AP Computer Science Principles


# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like

- Find your nametag and stand it up on your desk
- Take a look at your grade in studentvue
- Discuss these questions with your neighbors:
    1. How many different numbers can we represent with 4 bits?
    2. How many decimal digits would we need to represent the same values?
    3. Can you come up with a new number system that expresses the same values using only one digit?


## Terminal Activity

- Use Nano to make a file on your desktop
- Read the file in binary using xxd -b <filename>
- Read the file in hex


# Recap Unit 1, Day 5

## Last time we...
- Looked at parts of a computer
- Invented counting systems with everyday objects

# Today: Images -> Binary

## Vocab review:
- Analog: Information in the real world
- Digital: Information converted for storage on a computer
- Abstraction: Taking something complex and making a simpler version
- Sampling: Collecting little pieces of information
- Loss: Information that you lose from sampling

## One more - Who is this?

## Fidelity
How closely does the digital information match the analog information?

- Low fideltiy ("lofi") - the digital version does not match the analog version very well
- High fidelity ("hifi") - the digital version does match the analog version well

## Images: Levels of abstraction
1. Divide an image into pixels
2. Convert each pixel into a single color
3. Map each color to the closest available color
4. Convert the color to binary

## Practice - Code.org Pixelation Tool
- Start with B&W

## Each pixel is actually 3 lights

## Practice - with colors
- Can you recreate this, using 3 bits per pixel?
