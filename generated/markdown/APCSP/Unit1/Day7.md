# About the test

## About this test
- 15 points
    - For context, the ascii art and mad libs assignments were each 5 points
- About half multiple choice, half short answer




# My Test Policies

## Test Rules
- No cheating
    - But you can have a cheat sheet
- It'll be on paper, with a bubble sheet
- No calculators (this matches the AP exam policy)

## Retake Policy - Quarterly Exam
- We'll have a quarterly exam at the end of each quarter
- The exam **is** your retake for everything in the quarter
- It's optional - and doesn't count as its own grade
- It will be divided into section
    - Each section corresponds to one unit test
    - You can choose to do each section or not
- The down side: no other retakes
    - If you do poorly on an exam early in the quarter, the bad grade will be in your studentview the whole quarter
