## New Retake/Redo Policy
Problem: most people who do retakes/redos are getting the same score

Solution: To do a retake/redo, you must complete the formative work!

...So I will only take a redo for this assignment if you've completed all the assigned work for Unit 2


# Upcoming Schedule

- Today: Preview/Prep for new unit
- Rest of week: Documentary
- After Break: Internet Unit
    * Plan to finish by end of quarter (1/26)
- March: Back to Programming
- April: Create Task - 9 hours of class time (Tentatively Starting 4/11)
