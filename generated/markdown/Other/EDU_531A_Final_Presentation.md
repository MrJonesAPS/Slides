# My Passions in CS Education

## Digital Citizenship

- Just like physical citizenship - students need instruction to understand their rights and responsibilities when they use technology.
- Students need to understand and engage successfully and thoughtfully with technology.
- Technology is always evolving. We can't just prepare students to use today's technology, we need to prepare them with the skills that they can bring to all future technologies.


## Creativity

- In my previous career, I observed that the most successful engineers are those who can come up with creative solutions to problems
- Teaching creativity involves promoting self-efficacy, critical thinking, and ability to make connections across disciplines.

## Self-efficacy - a TLTC Goal
- Transforming Learning for the Third Century (TLTC) - University of Michigan's "Engaged Learning Goals"
- Five key 21st century skills, including:
- "Self-Agency and the Ability to Innovate and Take Risks"

## Creativity study

![FNIRS](../images/fnirs.jpg)

## Intuition

- Computer Science = The study of problem solving
- Fundamental skills include breaking problems down, estimation

# Literacy Skills - Critical Literacy

## Critical Literacy

- Understand why so much misinformation exists online
- Logical fallacies
- Question author intent

## Critical Literacy

:::{class="image-row"}
:::{.element: class="fragment fade-in"}
![](../images/bad_news_game.png)
:::

:::{.element: class="fragment fade-in"}
- Interactive game that helps students understand how and why misinformation is so prevalent on the internet
- Proven to "inoculate" students against fake news in the real world
:::
:::


# Literacy Skills - Fluency

## Fluency

- Students need to understand how and why things work, not just regurgitate formulas
- "Knowing a thousand formulas is not the same as knowing mathematics"

## Fluency - Activities that promote conceptual understanding

## Fluency - Fermi Problems
Estimation skills - Fermi Problems

## Speaking & Teamwork

:::{class="image-row"}
:::{.element: class="fragment fade-in"}
![](../images/innovators.jpg)
:::

:::{.element: class="fragment fade-in"}
- Innovations come from teams, not individuals
- Successful scientists and engineers need to be able to collaborate, explain, pitch, and promote their work.

:::
:::

## Speaking - Class debates

- Good opportunity to tie in ethics and digital citizenship
- Some of my favorite topics:
    - Should the government ban TikTok?
    - Supreme Court case - Gonzales v Google
    - 2015 Apple v FBI case about iPhone encryption

## Speaking - Shark Tank


:::{class="image-row"}
:::{.element: class="fragment fade-in"}
![](../images/shark_tank.jpg)
:::

:::{.element: class="fragment fade-in"}
- Give students a chance to practice their "elevator pitch"
- Helped students think about the role of their STEM work in society
