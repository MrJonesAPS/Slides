# Psychology Research

## Georgetown University Research Study
- Your students have an opportunity to participate in a research study
- Creativity in STEM

## The Study
- Two FNIRS scans - beginning and end of the year
- At Wakefield High School
- Compensation! $20/session

![FNIRS](../images/fnirs.jpg)




# First, some basic agreements

## Things I believe
- Computer programming is super fun!
- The world needs more computer programmers
    - You don’t have to become a computer programmer - Everyone would benefit from understanding computer programming
- EVERYONE can be good at computer programming
    - You don’t need to be great at math, science, or any other subject to be a great computer programmer
- EVERYONE can succeed in this class
    - And if you succeed in this class, you will become a good computer programmer
- If you don’t understand something in this class, it’s probably my fault, not yours

## My Goals
1. Safety
2. Teach Computer Programming
3. Teach Workplace Skills
4. Have Fun!
5. Assign Grades and Assess Competencies

## Workplace Readiness
A requirement of this course

We'll talk about jobs, learn how to make resumes, etc

Practice professional communication (I'm not your "bruh")

# Class Expectations

## Put your phones away
- Computers and headphones too
- During instruction, I have no patience for this
- You're welcome to listen to music during independent work

## Leaving class
- You're trapped during the first/last 10 minutes

![A hall pass](../images/hall_pass.jpg)

## Let me know if you need help!
I try to talk one-on-one with every student every day

# Grading

## First - what does a grade mean?
"An inadequate report of an inaccurate judgment by a biased and variable judge of the extent to which a student has attained an undefined level of mastery of an unknown proportion of an indefinite material" 

- Paul Dressel (1983)

## Formative vs Summative
- Formative: assessment **for** learning
    - eg. most classwork, warmups, exit tickets
- Summative: assessment **of** learning
    - eg. tests, projects

## Pop quiz - formative or summative?
- This pop quiz
- A warmup quiz
- A daily classwork coding assignment
- An end-of-unit multiple choice test
- A 2-week project

## Grades in my class are 100% Summative!
- I will give you feedback (and sometimes grades) on formative assignments
- Only tests and projects count towards your grade
- I will make it clear when you're working on a summative assignment

## Retakes - NEW THIS YEAR
- Every teacher is required to allow retakes on every summative assignment
- Each teacher can set their own rules for exactly how this works
- In my class, you'll need to complete all formative work before the retake

## Points system
- I'll weight different assignments differently
- I'll explain more about this as the year goes on

# Some more about this class

## Tons of resources
- I don't like to reinvent things, so we'll use a lot of these resources
- But I also don't have a single website I love, so we'll bounce around a lot




# Let's talk about AI


## AI - Rule in my class
- I think it's a great thing, and an important skill for you to learn
- We'll have a lot of fun with AI this year
- Unless I say so, do not use it on any assignments
- If you claim AI-generated work as your own, I will catch it and I will write a referral
    - Same rule for youtube videos, quillbot, course hero, chegg, etc.


## Here's some food for thought
