# Today - Objects

## An object is a collection of information and functions
* In Python, everything is an object!
* An object has information
* An object has behavior
* In this unit, we'll make our own objects

## You already know some objects
* String: Has length, and functions like upper()
myString = "asdf"
print(myString.upper())

## Objects belong to classes
* Class - the "type" of the object
* All objects in the same class have the same information and behavior

## Let's play a game


# Group-work

## Groupwork
With a partner discuss how an object would be useful for one of these Python programs:

- To-Do List
- Grade Calculator
