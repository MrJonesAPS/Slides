# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like
Discuss these questions at your table:

- What is the difference between a class and an object?
- What classes do you already know in Python?

# Today - Objects

## An object is a collection of information and functions
* In Python, everything is an object!
* An object has information
* An object has behavior
* In this unit, we'll make our own objects

## You already know some objects
* String: Has length, and functions like upper()

        myString = "asdf"
        print(myString.upper())

## Objects belong to classes
* Class - the "type" of the object
* All objects in the same class have the same information and behavior

## Let's play a game
- From Canvas, download the appropriate script
- We'll play this game in the Python interpreter

## To play the game
- From the command line, run with this command:

    python3 -i starfish_setup.py

    or

    python3 -i vampire_setup.py

- Read the instructions that it prints


# Quiz Next Class

## Quiz - using custom objects
- I will give you a class, and a list of functions that the class has
- You will write the code to create an object of the class, and call some functions

# Project

## Project Introduction
- You'll make your own Python interpreter game
- We'll work on this project the whole unit
- Today's goal - come up with an idea
