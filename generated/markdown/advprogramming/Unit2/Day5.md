## A note about plagiarism
You must write your own code!!!Â 

You are welcome to use code that you didn't write (eg code from StackOverflow or ChatGPT), as long as you follow these steps:

- Add a comment with the URL where you found the code
- Make it very clear which lines of code you copied vs which lines are your own
- Know that I will only grade the lines that are your own


If you include code that you did not write and that does not follow these steps:
