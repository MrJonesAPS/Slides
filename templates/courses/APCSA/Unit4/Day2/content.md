## About the Pokemon Project
- Lots of people wrote their code in about one minute
- Lots of people submitted code that was exactly the same as other students' code
- Lots of people submitted very advanced code
    - many of those same people failed the test on the same subject


## My Response
- For now, nothing
- Copy/paste is blocked going forward
- For all future projects, I'll assume that you aren't working alone
    - Working together, AI, etc are all okay. But you MUST give credit to your sources and explain how much of the work is yours
    - Sample acceptable comment: "I copy/pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and entirely kept the code it generated"
- You must completely understand the code you submit
- Each assignment will have an in-class component
