# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like
* Find your nametag and stand it up on your desk
* Get out your flippy do and your bingo card
* With your table, discuss this question:
"A computer program uses 3 bits to represent integers. When the program adds the decimal (base 10) numbers 5 and 3, the result is 0. What is the best explanation for the result?"

## Overflow! We'll talk more about this later
