# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like
- Find your nametag and stand it up on your desk
- Write a Python program that makes change using only quarters:
    - Ask for how much change you need to make
    - If you can make that using only quarters, respond with the number of quarters needed
    - Otherwise, print "sorry, I only have quarters"
