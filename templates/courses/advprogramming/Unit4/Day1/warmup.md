# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like
Copy this code into VSCode

Try providing some inputs. How many different types of errors can you get?

Use the error slides to help come up with ideas!

```Python
first = float(input("What is your first number? "))
second = float(input("What is your second number? "))
print(f"{first} divided by {second} is {first / second}")
```
