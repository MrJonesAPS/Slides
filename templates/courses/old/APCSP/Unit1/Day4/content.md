# Today: Representing more complex data

## Before we start, some vocab:
- Analog
- Digital
- Abstraction
- Sampling
- Loss

## Before we start, some vocab:
- Analog: Information in the real world
- Digital: Information converted for storage on a computer
- Abstraction: Taking something complex and making a simpler version
- Sampling: Collecting little pieces of information
- Loss: Information that you lose from sampling

## Images: Levels of abstraction
1. Divide an image into pixels
2. Convert each pixel into a single color
3. Map each color to the closest available color
4. Convert the color to binary

## Practice - with black and white
- See "Black and White Images Activity" on Canvas
