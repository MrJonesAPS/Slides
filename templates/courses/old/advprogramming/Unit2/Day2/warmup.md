# Warmup

## Come on in - sit anywhere you like
Prepare for the class/object quiz

Best way to practice is with the stafish/vampire game


## Quiz - Answer these on a sheet of paper
- Imagine that you are writing a Python program for a zoo that contains lions and sloths. Assume that these classes have already been defined.
    - The class Lion has these functions:
        - eat(food) 
        - roar()
    - The class Sloth has these functions:
        - sleep(time)
        - squeak()
- On a sheet of paper, do this:
    - Write code to create two lion objects and two sloth objects.
    - Write four function calls - write one call to each of the functions listed above
