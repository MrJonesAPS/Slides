Warmup: Write python code to answer this question:

In cooking, 1 cup is equal to 16 tablespoons. 

A recipe calls for 1 and 1/4 cups of sugar.

I am making a huge amount of this recipe for a banquet, so I need to multiply this recipe by 10. How many cups and how many tablespoons of sugar do I need?
